# Predict-the-CO2-Emission-from-the-cars
Climate change due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is one of the most complex challenges threatening our planet. This issue considered as a great and international  concern that primary attributed from different fossil fuels.     To reduce the effect of Global Warming caused mainly due to CO2 cars manufacturing companies are pre-estimating the CO2 emissions for a newly manufactured car that is about to launch in near future based on the features of the car.   This project deals with estimating the CO2 Emissions for a newly manufactured car by making a regression model which can accurately predetermine the car CO2 emissions before it is being manufactured/launched.
